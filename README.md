The dataset is obtained from fivethirtyeight (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/house-forecast-2018)

Tech stack: 
Python Scikit learn ---> model implemetaion
tensorflow tf.app.run module to run data.py
Flask ---> server side RESTful engine
Docker 
AWS lambda for deployment

Check readme.ipynb jupyter notebook for data exploration process.
